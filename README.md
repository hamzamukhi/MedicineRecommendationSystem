# MedicineRecommendationSystem

The "Medicine Recommedation System" project is an innovative system designed to analyze a comprehensive dataset of medicines and provide personalized recommendations based on user symptoms, medicine composition, and user reviews. Leveraging advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist users in making informed decisions about suitable medications. The system includes clustering for group-based recommendations, relevance scoring based on symptom similarity, and composition-based filtering to identify alternatives with minimal side effects. By combining natural language processing (NLP) with statistical analysis, "Medicine Recommedation System" delivers a user-friendly, data-driven platform for reliable, individualized medicine recommendations.

Outcomes:
1. Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of 11,825 medicine records by handling duplicates, null values, and non-standard entries, ensuring high data quality and consistency.
2. Conducted comprehensive EDA, visualizing data distributions, and identifying key trends in review percentages, usage, and side effects of medicines.
3.  Analyzed top manufacturers by medicine production volume and calculated average review ratings, supporting insights into industry trends.
4.  Engineered features like Combined Features for machine learning and Relevance score to evaluate medicine similarity for recommendation tasks.
5.  Created a custom side effects analysis, identifying the most common side effects across medications and filtering irrelevant terms for improved data accuracy.
6.  Built an NLP-based recommendation engine using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to match medicines to user-provided symptoms or problems.
7.  Implemented a clustering algorithm (K-means) to categorize medicines into groups, enhancing group-based recommendation capabilities.
8.  Developed a symptom-to-medicine recommendation function with relevance-based ranking, providing personalized medicine suggestions based on symptoms.
9.  Created a composition-based recommendation feature with side-effect filtering, allowing users to find alternate medicines that meet specific criteria.
10. Visualized common medicine uses and side effects with word clouds, bar charts, and correlation matrices to present findings in an intuitive manner.
11. Employed scatter plots, heatmaps, and distribution plots to illustrate review score trends and identify outliers in review ratings.
